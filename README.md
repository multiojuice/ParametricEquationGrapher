# Overview
The intitial draft of this will be a python interpretation of the algorithm and calculator to do the actual math, and construct the points in an order that they can be drawn in a single motion.

# What is a parametric equation?

# Tools
- Python3
 - I might need to use Python Turtle to draw out my initial algorithm to simulate the laser pointer and the path it will take to draw out the graph.
- Future Tools
 - Arduino Uno
 - Arduino Language
 - PySerial
 - Laser Pointer
 - Maybe a mirror??
